More Pleasant Editing on Commit Message
=======================================

When you type `git commit`, Vim starts and opens a commit buffer.  This plugin improves
the commit buffer.  Split the buffer to 3 windows; edit window, status window and diff
window.  You no longer need to repeat scroll and back to former position in order to
see long commit diff.

## Future

- Scroll diff window from insert mode in edit window.
- Cooperate with [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive).
